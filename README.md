# Penrose Tiles For Fun and Profit

This is an implementation of Penrose Tiles in JS.

The initial version in this repo used react but beyond a depth of about 11
it became unusable, locking up my browser. The current implementation uses
vanilla js and a `canvas` to draw.

## Get tiling

```
npm i && npm start
```
